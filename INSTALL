=== Building Runcible ===

You will need:
- Qt 4.x (tested only on 4.5)
- Poppler 0.10.x
- Poppler/Qt4
- the usual complement of build tools

Do this:
  qmake
  make


=== Running Runcible ===

Runcible currently requires some environment settings.  We've packaged
them into a script for you.  To run your binaries, execute
  ./demo.sh
